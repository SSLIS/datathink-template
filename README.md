# Datalogical Thinking Project Template
This GitHub template was designed to help students of the [*Datalogical Thinking*](https://www.hb.se/globalassets/global/international-office/kursplaner-ischool/ht23_datalogical-thinking-c3mdt1.pdf) course get started with their group project work. 

## About the Assignment
For this assignments, students work together in a group to curate 
a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. Students are asked to publish their dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on their project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages. Students can use this template as a starting point to organize their GitHub repositories.
